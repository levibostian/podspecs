# podspecs

cocoapods podspecs for projects that do not include podspecs. 

> Note: I use these podspecs mostly for my own projects. Feel free to install any of the pods published in your projects, but the pod may become a version behind. 

# Deployment 

* Update the podspec file that you want. 
* Merge the change into `main`. 
* Manually run github action that publishes the podspec to cocoapods.
